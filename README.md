# Design and Verification using Verilog

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains Verilog-based design and verification projects. It covers digital circuits ranging from basic logic gates to advanced modules. Each project includes RTL design, testbenches, and simulation results to demonstrate the complete design and verification flow.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Learn digital design using Verilog HDL.  
- Implement fundamental and advanced digital circuits.  
- Develop testbenches for functional verification.  
- Analyze simulation results using waveform viewers.  
- Provide a structured resource for students and engineers.  


- **RTL Code (.v)** → Contains the Verilog design files.  
- **Testbench (.v)** → Contains testbenches for verification.  
- **Waveform/Logs** → Simulation results.  

## ⚙️ Tools Used
- **Verilog HDL** for design and verification.  
- **Simulation Tools**:  QuestaSim / Icarus Verilog / Xilinx Vivado.  
- **Waveform Analysis**: GTKWave, ModelSim Viewer, or Vivado.
